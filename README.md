# jetbrains-mono-fonts

JetBrains Mono is a developer-oriented font family. Its forms are simple and free from unnecessary details. Rendered in small sizes, the text looks crisper. The easier the forms, the faster the eye perceives them and the less effort the brain needs to process them. The shape of ovals approaches that of rectangular symbols. This makes the whole pattern of the text more clear-сut. The outer sides of ovals ensure there are no additional obstacles for your eyes as they scan the text vertically. Characters remain standard in width, but the height of the lower-case is maximized. This approach keeps code lines to the length that developers expect, and it helps improve rendering since each letter occupies more pixels. JetBrains Mono uses a 9° italic angle; this maintains the optimal contrast to minimize distraction and eye strain. The usual angle is about 11°–12°. The inclusion of specific ligatures will enhance source code rendering.
